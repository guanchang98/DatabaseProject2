## 6. What is the project? & What was the original proposal?

The project is to implement a web application for a driving school scheduling system allowing both managers and students to use it. The original proposal was that managers can create, read, update, and edit the courses' information from the manager page. Besides, students can create an account, register for courses, and find information about them.
